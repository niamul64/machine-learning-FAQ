SciKit Learn has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and it's designed to work with a Python numerical and scientific <br>
libraries: NumPy and SciPy.<br>
<strong>implementing machine learning models with SciKit Learn is really easy with a few lines of Python code.</strong><br><br>
Most of the tasks that need to be done in a machine learning pipeline are implemented already in Scikit Learn including<br>
pre-processing of data, feature selection, feature extraction, train test splitting, defining the algorithms, fitting models,<br> tuning parameters, prediction, evaluation, and exporting the model
