Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group.<br>
In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features.<br>
Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.<br>
