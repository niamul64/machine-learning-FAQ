<strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong><br>
Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation.<br>
It finds the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.<br>
Here, In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.

The above image shows the robot, diamond, and fire. The goal of the robot is to get the reward that is the diamond and avoid the hurdles that are fire. The robot learns by trying all the possible paths and then choosing the path which gives him the reward with the least hurdles. Each right step will give the robot a reward and each wrong step will subtract the reward of the robot. The total reward will be calculated when it reaches the final reward that is the diamond.

Main points in Reinforcement learning â€“ <br>



Input: The input should be an initial state from which the model will start<br>
Output: There are many possible output as there are variety of solution to a particular problem<br>
Training: The training is based upon the input, The model will return a state and the user will decide to reward or punish the model based on its output.<br>
The model keeps continues to learn.<br>
The best solution is decided based on the maximum reward.<br>
